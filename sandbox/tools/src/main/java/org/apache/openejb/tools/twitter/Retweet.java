/**
 *
 * We should monitor this feed http://twitter.com/#!/OpenEJB/contributors
 * and retweet anything that mentions OpenEJB
 *
 * So if anyone in the contributors list tweeted about OpenEJB, the OpenEJB twitter account would retweet it
 *
 * Two things will happen as a result:
 *   -  The more activity on the OpenEJB twitter account the more followers it will get
 *   -  The more @joe and other contributors are seen on the account, the more followers they will get
 *
 * The OpenEJB twitter account has more followers than most everyone else so getting it
 * to retweet is a good way to expose people to all our wonderful contributors
 * and get them some followers and help the project at the same time.
 *
 * The result is we as a community will have more ability overall to get the word out!
